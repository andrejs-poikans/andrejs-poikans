            <br><br>
            The performance is made for any number of participants.
            It involves a frequency detection algorithm, sine tones and 
            has an open goal to exchange existing frequency sets between speakers. 
            The sets are changing in accordance to the sounds of the environment 
            where the performance takes place, in some cases this involves an 
            environment where music is played.
